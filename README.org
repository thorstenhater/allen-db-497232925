* Arbor Port of Allen DB Cell Model ~#497232925~

- Uses a slightly modified morphology to patch around Arbor's and Allen's
  difference in opinion about SWC.
  - I added a $1e-3 \mu m$ root segment id=0 with parent=-1
  - Shifted all /other/ ids and parents by $+1$
  - Patched the suspicious parent 11 somewhere in the middle to 1139 which is
    listed directly above. Might be a typo in reconstructing the file might be
    incorrect on my side. Either way, without this, the file won't load.
- In the current form spike counts /do not match/, which could have all kinds of
  reasons
  - Allen's simulations alter the axon at runtime, we don't.
  - Numerical differences.
  - Use (or absence) of Nernst.
  - A buggy mechanism, I am looking at you, ~CaDynamics~
  - Error in parsing/applying ~fit.json~

* Result
At $I=200pA$
